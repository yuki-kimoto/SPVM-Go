=head1 Instance Methods

=head2 read_start

C<method read_start : void ($buffer : mutable string, $buffer_length : int, $cb : L<Go::UV::Callback::Read|SPVM::Go::UV::Callback::Read>, $buffer_offset : int = 0);>

Starts reading data into C<$buffer> with length C<$buffer_length> and offset C<$buffer_offset> from the stream. 

The callback C<$cb> is stored in L</"read_cb"> field. The buffer C<$buffer> is stored in L</"read_buffer"> field. The length C<$buffer_length> is stored in L</"read_buffer_length"> field. The offset C<$buffer_offset> is stored in L</"read_buffer_offset"> field.

The callback C<$cb> is invoked when data has been read from the stream.

This method calls the L<uv_read_start|https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_read_start> function internally.
